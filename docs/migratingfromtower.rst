====================
Migrating from Tower
====================

Tower and Puente have some differences. If you're using Tower, then you'll need
to do something like the following to switch to Puente.

1. Upgrade to Python 2.7.

   Puente doesn't support Python 2.6, so you're going to have to upgrade.

2. Upgrade to Django 1.7.

3. If you're using Jingo, switch to 0.7.1.

4. Switch from ``messages.po(t)`` to ``django.po(t)``.

   Tower let you have many domains and defaulted to ``messages.po(t)``.

   Puente is moving closer to vanilla Django. Django uses ``django.po(t)`` and
   ``javascript.po(t)``, so Puente does, too.

   * If you just have ``messages.po(t)`` and ``javascript.po(t)``, then rename
     your ``message.po(t)`` to ``django.po(t)`` and sync with your translation
     system (e.g. Verbatim, Pontoon, etc).

   * If you have a bunch of domains and you can squash them all into
     ``django.po(t)`` and ``javascript.po(t)``, then do that.

   * If you have a bunch of domains and can't squash them into ``django.po(t)``
     and ``javascript.po(t)``, then we should talk--open up an issue.

5. Switch from Tower to Puente.

   Puente works with Django 1.7 and Jingo 0.7.1. It also works with Django 1.8
   and django-jinja.

   FIXME: Need to make sure Puente works with Django 1.7 first.

   1. Remove Tower

   2. Add Puente

   3. Make the configuration changes

      FIXME: Configuration changes here; probably point to configuration chapter
      with some helpers for TOWER -> PUENTE configuration conversion.

   4. Fix strings from non-trans-blocks that had whitespace in them in your
      code.

      Puente only collapses whitespace for ``trans`` blocks--it no longer
      collapses whitespace for all things. Given that, you want to fix your
      original strings so that the msgids don't change which will create extra
      work for translators.

      One easy way to do this is switch to Puente and then run::

        ./manage.py extract

      and see which msgids changed, then go fix those.

      Generally, you want to switch from Tower to Puente with zero msgid
      changes.
