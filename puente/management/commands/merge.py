    """Updates all locales' PO files by merging them with the POT files.

    The command looks for POT files in locale/templates/LC_MESSAGES,
    which is where software like Verbatim looks for them as well.

    For a given POT file, if a corresponding PO file doesn't exist for
    a locale, the command will initialize it with `msginit`. This
    guarantees that the newly created PO file has proper gettext
    metadata headers.

    During merging (or initializing), the command will also look in
    `locale/compendia` for a locale-specific compendium of
    translations (serving as a translation memory of sorts). The
    compendium file must be called `${locale}.compendium`,
    e.g. `es_ES.compendium` for Spanish.  The translations in the
    compendium will be used by gettext for fuzzy matching.
